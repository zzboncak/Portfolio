            <p>Hi, I’m Zack Zboncak (zuh-bon-sack) and I am a web developer who loves Javascript.</p>
            <p>I am a web developer and a recent graduate of Thinkful’s Engineering Nights and Weekends program. 
                I’ve always had a love for technology and solving problems. 
                Nothing is more satisfying than taking an idea in your head, implementing it in code, and watching it successfully work. 
                While you’ll primarily find Apple products in my home, I love gadgets of any kind, 
                toying with them, and making life easier with them (hey Alexa, set the thermostat to 70).</p>
            <p>When I’m not coding, I’m generally spending time with my wife and 3 very energetic young boys, 
                from whom I’m often inspired to create new projects (see my basic math practice app). 
                We love camping, nature walks, family movie nights. As a person, I love a good book, a good craft beer, 
                and spending time with the people who mean the most to me.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: If I really like a movie or book, I tend to buy multiple copies (for reasons unbeknownst to me or my wife).</p>

            <p class="description description-left">This project was inspired by my 4 year old son who wanted to start learning math. 
                It randomly generates two numbers to add and evaluates if the user’s input is the correct answer.</p>
